## Lessons Learned

- How to develop a full-stack application
- Component Oriented, Atomic Design - They are to be obtained to boost frontend development productivity. It also serves consistency and simplicity of UI/UX.
- How to use Redux - It took a rather long time to grasp the entire lifecycle of Redux.
- Tailwind is just an amazing one.
- The first DB scheme design is very crucial - Well design first with ER Diagram.
- Laravel was not for this application - Too heavy but fewer things to do with it. As I wanted to use React and completely separate frontend and backend, selecting Laravel (and maybe PHP even) was one of the biggest failures.
- Big capture in Laravel
- CORS issues robbed the biggest time from me. - It basically happens when an Origin wants to access the other without an appropriate header. Adding a proper header on app.php and NGINX solved all.
- CSRF issue - Without proper authentication, this problem will explode. Excluding API route from CSRF guard in VerifyCsrfToken.php activated API in public.
- How to design APIs
- If the project is too big, it's difficult to deploy. - Tried to deploy on Azure, as the project size exceeds the free range, couldn't deploy it. Regarding any other platforms, I already used up free range.
